Welcome to my new personal website! This site is built using **Jekyll** and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme, hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

Here, I will share my research progress, R programming tips, and insights into multivariate statistics. My goal is to create a space where data science meets ecology.

### What to expect:
- Tutorials on using `multiStatPlot`.
- Discussions on ecological modeling.
- Updates on my latest publications.

Stay tuned!
