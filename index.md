title: "About Me"
---

Welcome to my academic space. I am **Peily Claud**, a dedicated researcher at the intersection of **Computational Ecology**, **Multivariate Statistics**, and **Data Science**. My academic journey is driven by a profound fascination with the intricate patterns of nature and a commitment to deciphering them through the lens of quantitative analysis.

### My Academic Philosophy

In an era of unprecedented environmental change, the complexity of biological communities presents both a challenge and an opportunity. I believe that the key to understanding ecological resilience lies in our ability to integrate high-dimensional data with robust statistical frameworks. My work is not just about running models; it is about finding the "signal" within the "noise" of nature. I strive to develop and apply analytical tools that are as elegant as the biological systems they describe.

### Research Focus & Expertise

My research portfolio is built on three primary pillars:

1.  **Advanced Multivariate Statistics**: I specialize in ordination techniques, including PCA, RDA, CCA, and NMDS. I am particularly interested in how these methods can be optimized to handle the "zero-inflated" and non-linear nature of ecological community data. My R package, `multiStatPlot`, is a testament to this interest, providing researchers with publication-quality visualization tools that bridge the gap between complex analysis and intuitive interpretation.
2.  **Machine Learning in Ecology**: Beyond traditional statistics, I explore the potential of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms—such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks—to predict species distributions and community assembly rules under various climate change scenarios.
3.  **Plant Functional Traits & Global Change**: I investigate how plant functional traits mediate ecosystem responses to environmental stressors. By combining field observations with computational modeling, I aim to predict how biodiversity loss impacts ecosystem services at multiple scales.

### Beyond the Lab

When I am not immersed in R code or analyzing datasets, I am an advocate for open science and reproducible research. I believe that scientific progress is accelerated when data and tools are shared freely across the global community. I also enjoy nature photography, which allows me to appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the ecosystems I study from a different perspective.

### My Vision

My ultimate goal is to contribute to a more sustainable future by providing the scientific community with the quantitative insights needed for effective conservation and management. I am always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of ecological data science. Whether you are a fellow researcher, a student, or a data enthusiast, I invite you to explore my work and reach out for a conversation.
